# ProjectHub

ProjectHub is a small SaaS-style project dashboard built with Next.js and Supabase.

ProjectHub keeps project work clear and practical: who owns what, what's due, what's blocked, and what's moving forward.

## Visual Showcase

Here's what ProjectHub looks like in action:

### Dashboard Customization

- `/projects`
- `/projects/new`
- `/projects/[id]`
- `/clients`
- `/tasks`
- `/team`
- `/team/[id]`
- `/settings`

## API overview

- `/api/projects` and `/api/projects/[id]`

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies exactly as recorded in `package-lock.json`:

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your Supabase project credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in the Supabase Dashboard.
3. Copy and run the contents of [supabase-schema.sql](supabase-schema.sql) to create all tables and RLS policies.
4. (Optional) Run [sql/seed_dummy_data.sql](sql/seed_dummy_data.sql) to populate the database with demo projects, members, clients, and activities.
5. (Optional) Run [sql/reset_dummy_data.sql](sql/reset_dummy_data.sql) if you want to remove the [DEMO] data later.

6. Optionally enable OAuth:

- Configure OAuth providers in Supabase Auth settings.
- Add provider-specific environment variables to `.env.local`.

### Production check

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Permission model (high-level)

- `admin`: full access
- `member`: can create/update most working data
- `viewer`: read-only dashboard access

## Notes

- Project client fallback is shown as `Internal project` when no client is selected.
- Avatar fallback order is: profile avatar -> OAuth avatar -> Gravatar/Libravatar -> generated fallback.
- This repository focuses on practical CRUD and dashboard usability first, then adds UX polish.
